I'm Caleb! You can find different completed projects and those in the works too.

I mainly like developing backend-related projects (and sometimes full-stack too!). I am also interested in learning about computer graphics and computer vision.

You can also check out the following groups for some group projects I contributed in:
* [HackthonGang](https://github.com/HackthonGang)
* [Resumeholic](https://github.com/Resumeholic)

Enjoy your time here. ðŸ˜„
